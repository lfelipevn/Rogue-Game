#Conception of the game Turret Annihilator 3000

##Personal changes made to the proposed architecture
- When a random map is generated, the boss room is similar to the turret room, but has two more turrets that shoot 
  in all 4 directions. This was just edited in order to add difficulty to the game. The class is named Level0BossRoom and
  it is in the package ch.epfl.cs107.play.game.icrogue.area.level0.rooms.

##Personal modifications
- A message of type TextGraphics was added as an attribute to ICRoguePlayer, indicating the remaining lives.
- Arrows thrown by turrets damage the player from distance and by contact. This way, the arrow consume one cell before the player's one
  and it seems like the arrowhead hit the player. However, the interaction by contact was kept and the player also receives damage if it is in the same cell
  that the arrow.
- The fire created while holding the staff is created in the cell in front of the player instead of in his 
  position.

## Added extensions
- With the actors that was possible, the corresponding sprite was replaced with a set of Sprites resulting in an Animation type (staff, fire, 
player, player with staff).
- When the player grabs the staff, its animation changes to the one holding the staff.
