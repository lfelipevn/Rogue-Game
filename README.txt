*Controls*
Directional Arrows: Move
X: Shooting fire (only while holding the staff)
W: Request view interaction (it can either be grabbing the staff or opening a locked door while having the 
corresponding key)

##Exploring the rooms 
You will have the possibility to move across the room, in 4 directions (up, down, right and left) being bounded by
walls, in each room you will find at least one door that connects to another room. Complete the room's challange to move to another one.

##Collecting keys and unlocking doors
In some of the rooms you'll find out that there are some doors that are closed and others that are locked. For 
opening the closed doors you'll just have to complete the challenge presented in the room. On the other hand, 
opening the unlocked doors implies:
1. Finding the key that corresponds to that door in some room of the level
2. Collect the key (you just have to step on it)
3. Return right in front of the locked door (facing towards it) and request to open it with the key "W"
If the key you have found is correspondent to the door, it will open.

##Shooting fire
First you'll have to find the staff in one of the rooms and grab it by pressing the key "W". Then you can shoot fire
by pressing the key "X". Notice that the fire will be shooted in the direction you're facing.

##Defeating the enemies
After entering a room with turrets you'll have to face them. Be careful! They will throw arrows at you that you will
have to avoid. In order to annihilate your enemies you'll have to either throw fire at them or step on them.

## End of Game
The game will end after completing all the necessary challenges in the rooms to unlock the boss rooms and, of 
course, defeating all the turrets in the boss rooms. You can also lose the game after losing your 5 lives to the 
enemies.
